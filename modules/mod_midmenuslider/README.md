Interactive menu module for Joomla. Text description slides over the menu item image on hover and slides back on mouseout.

Mid Menu Slider lets you highlight up to four (4) menu items with an attractive interactive image link. When the user hovers over the image, a panel will slide in from the bottom displaying your custom description. 

Mid Menu Slider is also fully customizable without any knowledge of CSS. Each link has the following customizations available from the admin console:

      *Optional second image for mouseover
      *Description text size and color
      *Slider panel background color
      *Apply a transparency to the slider panel
      *Height of slider
      *Adjust the panel's slide speed
      
This is the first free extention from Paradigm Custom Solutions. Future development plans include a suite of new modules for Bootstrap 3 enabled templates.
